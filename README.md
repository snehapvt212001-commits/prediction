This project implements a voice-first, agentic AI system that helps users identify government welfare schemes they are eligible for using real-time voice interaction in Odia.

The system listens to the user's voice, understands their details, reasons about eligibility using ML + rules, and responds back in Odia voice with clear explanations.

This is not a chatbot — it demonstrates:

autonomous reasoning

tool usage

memory

failure handling

decision making
Real-time microphone input

 Native Odia language pipeline (STT → Reasoning → TTS)

 Agentic workflow (Plan → Execute → Evaluate)

 Eligibility engine using ML models

Scheme retrieval from memory

🔁 Clarification loop for missing/ambiguous inputs

🔊 Voice response with explanation
